1. PropTypes are used to check the type of the property we receive, it helps developers know what data they are dealing with and its a great tool for scalability since more complex apps means more complex props

2. A lifecycle event like CDM or CDU is a react method that is read by the compiler together with the entire class. They have different goals to achieve and use cases, CDM is usually used for setting up state or fetching data while CDU is able to compare the current with the prev state

3. an HOC is a function that takes as a parameter react components and is able to return them with some changed to it.

4. You can style a react app using normal css or less/scss, it is a very classic and old school way, something that everyone is used to. You can use reactstrap, it can give you quite fast some of the components that you need. styled-components is another way to do it and it is great because we can use the same mindset as in react and exactly building everything with components, it also is useful since our css does not cascade and eliminates a lot of bugs
